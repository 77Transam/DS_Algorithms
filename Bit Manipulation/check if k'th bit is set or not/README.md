# Algorithm to check if k'th bit is set or not

## Note: 
Set bit = 1 <br>
Unset bit = 0 

## Implementation
I implemented two methods to check id k'th bit is set or not.
<ol>
    <li>Left shift method</li>
    <li>Right Shift method</li>
</ol>

Time and space complexities for both the methods is same : <br>

Space: ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=O(1))
