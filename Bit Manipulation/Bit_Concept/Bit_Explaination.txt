Bit manipulation 

1>. counting the number of the set bits in the binary representations : 
   in binary representation 0 are called -non set bit
   1- set bits
   to count the set bit we take bitwise with 1 and with the 0th bit and every time make a right shift to the number untill it become zero
   if 0th bit is 1 then on bitwise  and will give 1 
   Time Complexity: since the number of iteration is atmost number of bits(32 or 64) there for the time complexity is O(1)

2>.Power of 2:
    a number is power of two when number of set bit is 1 
    time Complexity : O(1) as just counting the number of set Bits
