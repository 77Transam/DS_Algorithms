# DS Algorithms

A collection of different types of algorithms used for various different Data Structures, in different languages.
This repository is open to all. 
To help you out with your Hacktoberfest goals!!.
All you need to do is just add any sorting algorithm of your choice in any language you like with only the condition that it hasn't already been added.


## Structure of the Repository

- The Repository contains folders with names of Data Structures the Algorithms are based on, or the Name of the Algorithms if its valid for multiple data Structures.
- Inside each folder there maybe subfolders for the Algorithms.
- Each Algorithm folder contains 

## Guidelines

- Go Inside the Data Structure or Algorithm folder (if already created, else create one).
- Create a  folder with the Algorithm Name. and language used to implement it. ( Eg: Insertion Sort-C++ )
- Add a .txt file with the Algorithm Theory/Explanation and a solution file which contains the solution of the given problem.
- Add this file inside the folder with the name of the algorithm you have implemented. If not present then create a new folder with the name of the algorithm and add your own folder to it.
- You can also help maintain a single text file containing the detailed explanation of all the algorithms.

Since we restructured it,it does not contain a single file for the algorithm.

## Steps

- Fork this repo (button on top)
- Star this repo (button on top)
- Clone on your local machine

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sorting-algorithms.git
```

- Create a new folder with the algorithm name and language.
- Add your algorithm and solution file in that folder. 
- Commit and push

```terminal
git add .
git commit -m 'Added algorithm-name'
git push origin master
```

- Create a new pull request from your forked repository
- And you are one step closer!

## Note

- Avoid overwriting other people's contributions, adding spaces and tabs or making any other type of invalid pull requests. 
 (They will be marked invalid and won't be counted in your HacktoberFest goals.)
