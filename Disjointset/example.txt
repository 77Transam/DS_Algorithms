Let us consider the following graph:

            0
          /   \
        /       \
        2--------1

For each edge, make subsets using both the vertices of the edge. 
If both the vertices are in the same subset, a cycle is found.

Initially, all slots of parent array are initialized to -1 (means there is only one item in every subset).

0   1   2
-1 -1  -1 
Now process all edges one by one.

Edge 0-1: Find the subsets in which vertices 0 and 1 are. Since they are in different subsets, 
we take the union of them. For taking the union, either make node 0 as parent of node 1 or vice-versa.


0   1   2    <----- 1 is made parent of 0 (1 is now representative of subset {0, 1})
1  -1  -1
Edge 1-2: 1 is in subset 1 and 2 is in subset 2. So, take union.


0   1   2    <----- 2 is made parent of 1 (2 is now representative of subset {0, 1, 2})
1   2  -1
Edge 0-2: 0 is in subset 2 and 2 is also in subset 2. Hence, including this edge forms a cycle.


How subset of 0 is same as 2?
0->1->2 // 1 is parent of 0 and 2 is parent of 1
