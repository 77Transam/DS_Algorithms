Interpolation Search
====================

Interpolation Search is an improvement over Binary Search. Interpolation search may go to different
locations according to the value of the key we are searching. For example, if the value of the key
is near to the last element, Interpolation Search Algorithm is likely to start search toward the end side.

To find the position that we have to search, it uses the following formula:

pos = st + [ (x – array[st])*(end – st) / (array[end] – array[st]) ]

array[] : Array where elements need to be searched
x       : Element to be searched
st      : Starting index in array[]
end     : Ending index in array[]


Complexities
============
Time Complexity  : O(log2(log2 n)) for the average case, and O(n) for the worst case (when items are
                   distributed exponentially)
Space Complexity : O(1)
