The term lexicographically means Dictionary format, i.e 
Given a string here "shaonakundu" in groups of size 3(k=3), we have to find the smallest and largest or greatest substring.
Initially from the beginning the first k letters are chosen as both min and max lexicographically.
Then a for loop is implemented to iterate over entire string for size of k and compare by removing one letter from the beginning and adding (k+1)th letter to form new substring.

After running this python code we get: ('aku', 'und') as the smallest and largest substring lexicographically.

Note: one can take user input for both string(s) and k so that one can experiment with different examples. Here I have taken particular string.
